    Draggable Todo is a clean, fast, simple, but powerful to-do list. You can easily create or edit your task, even drag tasks to sort as you want. Furthermore, it has markdown link support. Creating tasks with link is no longer a problem.

    You can benefit from this extension if you:
    - Have a to-do, action, follow-up or just an interesting item to jot down 
    - Want to check your personal to-do list
    - Feel like youâ€™re always forgetting something

    All you have to do is open a new tab, and your item is there. Write, read, cross out. Enjoy it!
